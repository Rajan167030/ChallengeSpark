# Product Requirements Document: MicroSpark

**Language**: English (for overseas users)
**Programming Language**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
**Project Name**: micro_spark

## Original Requirements

Develop an app focused on overseas users called "MicroSpark" (碎片时间挑战器) that helps users make the most of their fragmented free time by suggesting micro-challenges based on available time duration (such as 5-minute speed writing, 10-minute meditation, 3-minute micro-workouts, speed-reading short articles, etc.). The app aims to solve the problem of wasted small pockets of time throughout the day and provides users with a sense of achievement and continuous challenge rewards to enhance user stickiness.

## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 Product Goals

1. **Time Optimization**: Help users transform idle fragments of time (1-15 minutes) into productive micro-activities that add value to their daily lives.

2. **Habit Formation**: Build positive micro-habits through consistent engagement with quick, achievable challenges tailored to users' interests and available time.

3. **Achievement Tracking**: Create a rewarding system that provides users with tangible evidence of their accomplishments and progress over time.

### 1.2 User Stories

1. **As a busy professional**, I want quick suggested activities that match my available time window so that I can be productive during short breaks between meetings.

2. **As a commuter**, I want easily accessible challenges I can complete on public transport so that my daily travel time feels purposeful and valuable.

3. **As a wellness-focused individual**, I want micro-challenges related to mindfulness and physical health so that I can maintain my wellbeing despite a hectic schedule.

4. **As a skill-builder**, I want bite-sized learning activities so that I can make progress on new skills even when I don't have large blocks of time available.

5. **As an achievement-oriented person**, I want to track my completed micro-challenges so that I can feel a sense of accomplishment from my cumulative efforts.

## 6. Final Considerations

The MicroSpark app addresses a universal pain point—the inefficient use of small pockets of time—with a solution that is both practical and psychologically rewarding. By focusing on micro-achievements and gradual habit building, the app has the potential to create meaningful behavior change while avoiding the overwhelm common to many productivity tools.

The key to success will be balancing simplicity with depth: the interface must be instantly comprehensible and require minimal interaction to begin a challenge, while the underlying system needs to be sophisticated enough to deliver personalized, varied content that keeps users engaged over time.

Unlike traditional to-do list apps that often become sources of guilt or pressure, MicroSpark positions itself as an opportunity-focused tool that helps users feel good about small accomplishments rather than overwhelmed by incomplete tasks.
